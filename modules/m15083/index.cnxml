<title>The human genome: chromosomes and genes </title>
<para id="para1">In 1953 Watson and Crick unlocked the structure of the <link url="http://www.nature.com/nature/dna50/watsoncrick.pdf">DNA
      molecule</link> and set into motion the modern study of
      genetics.
      This advance allowed our study of life to transcend the wet
      realm of proteins, cells, organelles, ions, and
      lipids, and move up into more abstract methods of analysis.
      By discovering the basic structure of DNA we had received our
      first glance into the information-based realm locked inside
      the genetic code.

<para id="element-992">The human genome contains 3 billion chemical nucleotide bases (A,C,
  T and G). About 30,000 genes are estimated to be in the human
  genome. The human genome has physical three-dimensional
  structure. The genome is 6 feet (2 meters) in length and is packed
  in the nucleus of our cells into a structure which is only 0.0004
  inches across (the head of a pin). The genome is divided among 24
  chromosomes (22 pairs of autosomes and one pair of sex chromosomes
  (X and Y)), and that genes lie on specific chromosomes. Human
  chromosomes are arranged according to size with Chromosome 1 being
  the largest, and the Y chromosome being the smallest. Matt Ridley's
  fascinating book <link url="http://www.amazon.com/Genome-Matt-Ridley/dp/0060932902">Genome</link>
  gives a great introduction to our chromosomes and the genes they
  contain. Chromosome 1 is believed to have 2968 genes, while the Y
  chromosome has 231 genes. To learn more about chromosomes, visit
  <link url="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/genome/genemap99/">GeneMap99</link>,
  a site maintained by the NCBI. Here is a diagrammatic representation
  of the 24 chromosomes.

</para>

<para id="delete_me">The average human gene contains about 3000
    bases. Sizes of human genes vary greatly. The largest known human
    gene is dystrophin (a muscle protein) at 2.4 million bases. The
    smallest genes are a little over a hundred base pairs long. Less
    than 2% of the genome codes for proteins. Repeated sequences that
    are not involved in coding for proteins (sometimes called "junk
    DNA") make up at least 50% of the human genome. These repetitive
    sequences play an important role in chromosome structure and
    dynamics. Over time, these repeats are believed to reshape the
    genome by rearranging it, creating entirely new genes, and
    modifying and reshuffling genes. Surprisingly, genes are not
    distributed uniformly through the human genome. Genes appear to be
    concentrated in sections of the genome with high GC content, with
    vast areas of non-coding DNA in between. There are long stretches
    of C and G repeats adjacent to gene-rich areas. These CpG islands
    are believed to regulate gene activity, and they serve as markers
    for gene-rich locations on the genome. We do not yet know the
    function of over 50% of the discovered genes. A great site to
    learn more about DNA is <link url="http://www.dnai.org">the DNAi

<title>Computational Genefinding </title>

<para id="para-2">
	
What is computational genefinding? Simply put, it is the development
of computational procedures to locate protein coding regions in
unprocessed genomic DNA sequence data.  In reality however,
pinpointing the mere location of a gene is part of a much larger
challenge.  The eukaryotic gene is a complicated and highly studied
beast composed of a  multitude of small coding regions and
regulatory elements hidden amidst tens of thousands of base pairs of
intronic and non-signal DNA.  In order to accurately predict gene
locations we must first understand how the different functional
components interact to create the dynamic and complex phenomena we
have come to understand as 'a gene'.


</para>

<para id="para-3">Thus genefinding is a little bit of a misnomer: in order to find genes we
must first understand the content and structure of the signal the
genes present to the cell's genetic machinery, and in doing this we
must answer much broader questions than the seemingly facile question,
"Where are the genes?"  The goal of genefinding then is not simple
gene prediction, but accurate modeling of the signal genes present to
the cell.  Furthermore, because such information does not exist in a
vacuum separate from it's interpretation, implicit in the assumption
of the ability to model the genetic signal is a furthering of our
capacity to understand the deciphering of the genetic signal and our
understanding of the inner workings of the cell itself.

<title> Genefinding in prokaryotic genomes </title> 

<para id="element-159">There are two basic approaches to gene finding: ab-initio and comparative. Ab-initio methods use statistical properties of the given genome, while comparative methods use annotations from previously analyzed genomes as an additional input. We will begin our discussion of gene finding with ab-initio methods as applied to simpler prokaryotic genomes. Examples of such genomes include H. influenzae (the influenza virus). Over 70% of H. influenzae codes for proteins. Genes in prokaryota are contiguous stretches of base pairs with no intronic breaks. There are untranslated regions (UTRs) that flank both ends of a gene: the 5' (5-prime) and 3' (3-prime end). Genes are directional -- they are read from the 5' to the 3' end. There are genes on both strands of the DNA double helix. Each gene starts with the amino acid methionine, specified by the three letter codon ATG. ATG is called the start codon. The end of a gene is signalled by one of three stop codons (TAA, TAG, TGA). The start codon signals  the ribosomal machinery to start translating the bases in composites of three into amino acids until the stop codon is reached. Gene finding in prokaryota reduces to the problem of finding stretches of the genome with a  start codon and a stop codons with no intervening stop codons. Such a stretch is called an open reading frame or ORF. 

</para>

<para id="ORF-para">

Given a sequence from {A,C,G,T}*, an open reading frame (ORF) is any subsequence that starts with the codon ATG and ends with a stop codon (TAA, TAG, TGA) with no stop codons in between. 
ORF finding algorithms are based on the following simple idea.
Since
coding regions are terminated by stop
codons, one needs to to look for long stretches of bases without
a stop codon. Once a stop codon is found,
we work backward to find the start codon
corresponding to the gene. Why do we look for long stretches without stop codons?
 If nucleotide bases were drawn uniformly
at random, then a stop codon is expected
once every 64/3 (about 21)codons, or about 63 base pairs.  By selecting an appropriate length threshold t (typically greater than 210 bases or 70 amino acids), we reduce the likelihood of picking a random sequence with a stop codon rather than an actual coding region.
Modifications to this basic algorithm to handle very short genes and
overlapping genes have been developed. The most successful method for finding coding regions in prokaryotic genomes is one based on interpolated Markov models emboded in the program GLIMMER. It is available <link url="http://cbcb.umd.edu/software/glimmer">here</link>. A 2007 Bioinformatics paper details how to use this tool.

<title>Genefinding in eukaryotic genomes </title>
<para id="eukaryote-gene-finding">
We now turn to ab initio approaches to gene finding in eukaryotic genomes. They rely on <emphasis> signals </emphasis> which are specific DNA sequences that indicate the  presence of a nearby gene, or <emphasis> content </emphasis> which are statistical properties of the gene itself. Examples of signals include promotor and regulatory sequences that precede a gene, binding sites for the polyA tail at the end of a gene, as well as CpG islands (stretches of DNA with high GC content) that occur before the start of a gene.

<para id="eukarotic-difficulties">

Eukaryotic genes are considerably more complicated than their prokaryotic counterparts. First, a gene is no longer a contiguous stretch of bases between the start codon and a stop codon. It is broken or spliced into coding regions called exons with intervening non-coding sections called introns. Splicing mechanisms in the eukaryotic cell stitch the exons together before translation. Alternative splicing mechanisms allow the exons to be put together in a variety of ways --- thus a single gene can code for a variety of proteins. The one gene - one protein mapping that is characteristic of prokaryotes is lost. Second, most DNA in eukaryotes is non-coding; only about 3% codes for proteins. Finding the exons in a sea of introns and intergenic material is very difficult. In addition, many of the regulatory signals may be quite far from the start codon. These factors make eukaryotic gene finders much less successful than their prokaryotic counterparts like GLIMMER with prediction accuracies of 98%.

<para id="approach">

Ab initio methods use information embedded in the genomic sequence exclusively to predict gene structure in eukaryotic genes. The problem of gene finding is usually posed as a probabilistic inference problem: find the structure G representing gene boundaries and internal gene structure which maximizes the probability of G given the genomic sequence. Hidden Markov models are the predominant generative method for the problem. Ab-initio methods allow for the prediction of novel genes, genes that are unlike any that are known. However, ab initio techniques are generally not effective in detecting alternately spliced forms, interleaved or overlapping genes. They also have difficulty in accurate identification of exon/intron boundaries. Almost all ab-initio gene finders generate large numbers of false positive predictions arising from learnign overfitted models on small training sets. With these caveats in mind, we embark on the study of Hidden Markov models for finding genes in complex eukaryotic genes.

<title>A simple example: finding CpG islands </title>

<para id="cpg1">
Normally a C (cytosine)  followed immediately by a G (guanine)  (a CpG) is rare in eukaryotic DNA because the Cs in such an arrangement tend to be methylated
<link url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CpG_island">[Wikipedia]</link>. This methylation helps distinguish the newly synthesized DNA strand from the parent strand, which aids in the final stages of DNA proofreading after duplication. However, over evolutionary time methylated Cs tend to turn into Ts because of spontaneous deamination. The result is that CpGs are relatively rare unless there is selective pressure to preserve them. 
In bulk human DNA CpG dinucleotides occur about five times less frequently
than expected (Bird 1980, Jones et al 1992). CpG islands are thus unmethylated regions of the genome
that are associated with the 5’ ends of most house-keeping genes and many regulated genes. The absence of methylation slows CpG decay, and so CpG islands can be
detected in DNA sequence as regions in which CpG pairs occur at close to the expected frequency.
The fact that CpG islands can be detected in this way indicates that the corresponding germline
DNA has been substantially hypomethylated for an extended period of time, and in fact about 80%
of CpG islands are common to man and mouse (Antequera and Bird 1993).
About 56% of human genes and 47% of mouse genes are associated with CpG islands (Antequera and
Bird 1993). Often CpG islands overlap the promoter and extend about 1000 base pairs downstream
into the transcription unit. Identification of potential CpG islands during sequence analysis helps
to define the extreme 5’ ends of genes, something that is notoriously difficult with cDNA based
approaches.
